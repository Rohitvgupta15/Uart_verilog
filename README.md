# Uart_verilog


🚀  Just completed a successful UART simulation in Verilog on the Basys 3 board, transmitting and receiving 8-bit data via RS232. 📡💻

🧐 UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) is a critical communication interface in embedded systems. It allows seamless serial data transfer between devices, making it an essential skill for FPGA and digital design enthusiasts.

🔧 In this project, we designed a UART transmitter and receiver in Verilog, implementing the necessary logic to send and receive 8-bit data. The Basys 3 board played a crucial role, both as the transmitter and receiver.

📤 On the transmission side, we used 8 switches on the Basys 3 board to input 8-bit data, which was then serially transmitted via RS232 and display in Tera term terminal in computer 🕹️

📥 On the receiving side, we received 8-bit data serially from Tera Term on the computer through RS232 and displayed it on 8 LEDs on the Basys 3 board. 💡

🔗 I've uploaded the complete code for this project on GitHub. You can check it out here: https://github.com/Rohitvgupta15/Uart_verilog.git

📈 The simulation results were spot on! The transmitted 8-bit data was correctly received and displayed on the LEDs. This success highlights the practical applications of UART in real-world scenarios and the power of Verilog in FPGA development.
